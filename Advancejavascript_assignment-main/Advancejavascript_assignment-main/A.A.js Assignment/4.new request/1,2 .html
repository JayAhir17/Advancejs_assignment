      <h1> <b>What is JSON</b></h1>

      <p>JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application, but it's also a common format for storing and exchanging data in many other contexts</p>

      <h1><B>What is Promises</B></h1>

      <p>  Promise is a result object that is used to handle asynchronous operations. It represents a value that may not be available yet, but will be resolved at some point in the future. A promise can be in one of three states:

        Pending: Initial state, where the operation has not started yet.
        Fulfilled: The operation has completed successfully, and the promise has a value.
        Rejected: The operation has failed, and the promise has an error.</p>
